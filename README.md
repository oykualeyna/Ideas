# Ideas
STM32F7 + Touch Sensor + RBG + Buzzer
The purpose of the application is creating a game where players earn points by correctly matching emojis with their corresponding colors. The game features four different colors and one neutral (colorless) option designed to mislead players. The name of our game is "Ideas". Each color is associated with an emoji, and touch sensors are placed above each emoji. When a new "idea" appears (indicated by the corresponding light turning on), and the player successfully matches the correct color with the emoji, their score increases. When the color changes, the buzzer emits two short beeps to signal the change. If the player makes an incorrect match, the buzzer emits a long "beep" sound, and the game restarts. The game consists of 4 levels, and the speed increases at each level. The player wins the game upon completing the final level.
